## Web Dashboard

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="January 2026 — Web App Release (Status: Live)">
    **New Features & Enhancements**

    - **Valentine's Campaign Support**: Launched themed promotional articles and in-app flyers to support seasonal marketing campaigns.
    - **Automated Ledger Alerts**: Implemented automated email notifications triggered whenever an Admin performs a manual balance adjustment to ensure oversight.

    **Fixes**

    - **Invoice Visibility**: Fixed a bug to ensure submitted invoices are correctly displayed on the transaction details screen for both Admin and Merchant apps.
    - **Admin Profile Accuracy**: Removed redundant fields in the Admin portal that were inconsistent with the Merchant-side onboarding process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="November 2025 — Web App Release (Status: Live)">
    **New Features**

    - **Manual International Wallet Requests**: Merchants can now request **USD**, **GBP**, and **EUR** wallets directly via the dashboard. This triggers a workflow for our Sales/Ops team to review and approve your request. You will receive an email notification upon approval.
    - **Zelle Payment Channel**: Added **Zelle** as a selectable payment channel when sending money to USD recipients. The interface now supports validation for Zelle-registered email addresses and mobile numbers.
    - **Transaction Fee Transparency**: The Transaction History table and export files (CSV/Excel) now include a granular breakdown of fees, separating **VAT**, **Transaction Fees**, and **Stamp Duty** for easier reconciliation.
    - **Payment Links**: We introduced Payment Links, a new way to collect payments without needing a website or app integration. You can now generate unique payment URLs instantly and share them with customers via WhatsApp, email, or social media to receive payments.

    **Improvements**

    - **Payment Links for Malawi**: We updated collection rules for Malawi (MWK) Payment Links:
        - **Mobile Money** is enabled for amounts under 750,000 MWK.
        - **Bank Transfer** is required for amounts between 750,000 MWK and 500,000,000 MWK.
    - **Global Onboarding Support**: The sign-up flow now supports address selection for multiple countries (e.g., USA, UK, Kenya, Canada), allowing non-Nigerian businesses to onboard seamlessly.
    - **Wallet Funding Details**: A new "Fund USD Wallet" modal provides a clear view of your banking details, including Account Number, Bank Address, and SWIFT code, making it easier to receive international deposits.

    **Fixes**

    - **Currency Persistence**: Fixed an issue where the "Amount" field value would persist when switching between different currency tabs in the Payment Links creation form.
    - **Sign-Up Validation**: Email validation on the sign-up form now triggers immediately when you click away from the field, rather than waiting for the "Continue" button press.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="October 2025 — Web App Release (Status: Live)">
    **New features**

    - Launched the rebuilt [meCash Developer Hub](https://developer.me-cash.com/) with guided quickstarts, an interactive API explorer, real-world use cases, and centralized support links so teams can ship integrations faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="September 2025 — Web App Release (Status: Live)">
    **New features**

    - Added a persistent Halt Payout banner that disables **Send/Transfer** whenever payouts, on-ramps, or off-ramps are paused, including tooltips that explain the outage.
    - Introduced scheduled maintenance banners so users know when services are temporarily suspended and when they will resume.
    - Expanded Canadian payout flows with validated input fields for institution number, transit number, and SWIFT/BIC to reduce submission errors.
    - Rolled out responsive in-app notification pop-ups for critical announcements such as payment provider changes.

    **Improvements**

    - Hardened deployment processes to keep all API endpoints online during releases.
    - Removed gas fees from Off-Ramp and crypto-to-crypto flows and updated withdrawal/confirmation screens accordingly.
    - Enhanced sign-up validation to mask whether an email already exists.
    - Refreshed trust indicators to highlight meCash’s Circle Alliance certification.

    **Bug fixes**

    - Cleared stale “Reason for Payment” selections after logout.
    - Fixed navigation on crypto withdrawals that previously redirected to the wrong quote page.
    - Resolved KYB submission timeouts and incorrect country-code defaults.
    - Corrected country/currency display issues on the public calculator.
    - Fixed intermittent CORS errors observed during login.
  </Accordion>

    - Published a user-facing maintenance mode page that communicates downtime status in real time.

    **Enhancements**

    - Clarified Send Money fee breakdowns and optimized the mobile-web experience.
    - Disabled the **Continue** button until a payment reason is selected to avoid accidental submissions.

    **Bug fixes**

    - Fixed crashes triggered by session timeouts.
    - Resolved the “Something Went Wrong” server error on the Send Money screen.

    - Faster KYB document review screen with side-by-side previews.
