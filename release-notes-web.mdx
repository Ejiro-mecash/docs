## Web Dashboard

### October 2025 — Web App Release (Status: Live)

**New features**

- Launched the rebuilt [meCash Developer Hub](https://developer.me-cash.com/) with guided quickstarts, an interactive API explorer, real-world use cases, and centralized support links so teams can ship integrations faster.

### September 2025 — Web App Release (Status: Live)

**New features**

- Added a persistent Halt Payout banner that disables **Send/Transfer** whenever payouts, on-ramps, or off-ramps are paused, including tooltips that explain the outage.
- Introduced scheduled maintenance banners so users know when services are temporarily suspended and when they will resume.
- Expanded Canadian payout flows with validated input fields for institution number, transit number, and SWIFT/BIC to reduce submission errors.
- Rolled out responsive in-app notification pop-ups for critical announcements such as payment provider changes.

**Improvements**

- Hardened deployment processes to keep all API endpoints online during releases.
- Removed gas fees from Off-Ramp and crypto-to-crypto flows and updated withdrawal/confirmation screens accordingly.
- Enhanced sign-up validation to mask whether an email already exists.
- Refreshed trust indicators to highlight meCash’s Circle Alliance certification.

**Bug fixes**

- Cleared stale “Reason for Payment” selections after logout.
- Fixed navigation on crypto withdrawals that previously redirected to the wrong quote page.
- Resolved KYB submission timeouts and incorrect country-code defaults.
- Corrected country/currency display issues on the public calculator.
- Fixed intermittent CORS errors observed during login.

### August 2025 — Web App Release (Status: Live)

**What's new**

- Added a dedicated OTC page for bespoke trades plus the ability to delete saved beneficiaries.
- Published a user-facing maintenance mode page that communicates downtime status in real time.

**Enhancements**

- Clarified Send Money fee breakdowns and optimized the mobile-web experience.
- Disabled the **Continue** button until a payment reason is selected to avoid accidental submissions.

**Bug fixes**

**What's new**

**Enhancements**

- Updated the FAQ experience for clearer answers.

**Bug fixes**

- Corrected currency symbols so each wallet shows the appropriate denomination.

### July 05, 2024 — v2.9.0 (Status: Rolling out)

- New real-time payout monitor with filtering by corridor and banking partner.
- Added downloadable audit exports (CSV) for wallet funding events.
- Redesigned *Developers → API Keys* to show per-environment permissions and last-used timestamps.

**Action needed:** If you embed dashboard links inside internal tools, refresh any saved URLs because navigation paths changed.

### May 22, 2024 — v2.8.1 (Status: Live)

- Faster KYB document review screen with side-by-side previews.
- Team Management now surfaces pending invitations and lets admins resend invites in bulk.
