meCash provides two isolated environments so you can build, test, and launch without risk. Use the sandbox for iterative development and only switch to production once your flows are certified.

## Sandbox environment

The sandbox mirrors live behavior while keeping funds virtual—perfect for prototyping and QA.

- **Authentication:** Use your sandbox API keys from the dashboard.  
- **Webhooks & events:** All endpoints fire test payloads so you can validate handlers.  
- **Data reset:** Wallet balances and transactions are synthetic and may reset periodically.

**How to access**

1. [Create your business account](/account-creation).  
2. Follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to generate sandbox keys.  
3. Whitelist the IPs that will call the API via [/ip-whitelisting](/ip-whitelisting).

<Tip>
  Keep development strictly in sandbox until you have end‑to‑end tests, webhook verification, and monitoring in place.
</Tip>

## Production environment

Production is where your customers experience real payouts, collections, and settlements.

- **Base URL:** `https://api.me-cash.com`.  
- **Traffic:** Real money movement with full compliance monitoring.  
- **Rate limits:** Higher throughput tiers are available on request—contact support with your projected volumes.  
- **API keys:** Issued separately from sandbox; never reuse test keys in production.

**Access prerequisites**

1. Complete KYB.  
2. Finish smoke testing in sandbox, including webhook verification.  
3. Request production keys from the dashboard or by emailing [support@me-cash.com](mailto:support@me-cash.com).  
4. Whitelist the production IP addresses that will originate live traffic.

<Note>
  Keep production credentials in a secure secrets manager. Rotate keys regularly and remove unused IP addresses to minimize attack surface.

    1. Build and test in sandbox.  
    2. Run automated contract and webhook tests.  
    3. Perform a supervised pilot in production.  
    4. Monitor logs and metrics continuously.

    - Maintain separate API keys and IP whitelists.  
    - Document every environment change.  
    - Use feature flags to control rollout.  
    - Set alerts for 4XX/5XX spikes.
