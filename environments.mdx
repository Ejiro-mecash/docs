meCash offers two environments to support your development workflow: **Sandbox** for testing and **Production** for live transactions.(The details for the Production Enviroment are not in this docs)

## Sandbox Environment

The Sandbox environment is perfect for development, testing, and integration before going live.

#### Sandbox Base URL
`https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com`

### Key Features:
- **Safe Testing:** Test all API functionality without affecting real accounts or transactions
- **Realistic Data:** Use test data that mirrors production behavior
- **Full API Access:** All endpoints and features available for testing
- **No Real Money:** All transactions are simulated

### How to Access:
- **Account Setup:** Create a [meCash sandbox account](/account-creation)
- **API Keys:** Generate sandbox API keys from your Developer dashboard
- **Testing:** Use sandbox keys for all development and testing

<Note>Always test your integration thoroughly in sandbox before moving to production.</Note>
