# meCash Environments

meCash offers two environments to support your development workflow: **Sandbox** for testing and **Production** for live transactions.

## Sandbox Environment

The Sandbox environment is perfect for development, testing, and integration before going live.

#### Sandbox Base URL
`https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com`

### Key Features:
- **Safe Testing:** Test all API functionality without affecting real accounts or transactions
- **Realistic Data:** Use test data that mirrors production behavior
- **Full API Access:** All endpoints and features available for testing
- **No Real Money:** All transactions are simulated

### How to Access:
- **Account Setup:** Create a [meCash sandbox account](/account-creation)
- **API Keys:** Generate sandbox API keys from your Developer dashboard
- **Testing:** Use sandbox keys for all development and testing

<Note>Always test your integration thoroughly in sandbox before moving to production.</Note>

## Production Environment

The Production environment processes real transactions with your users.

#### Production Base URL
`https://api.me-cash.com`

### Key Features:
- **Real Transactions:** Processes genuine payments and affects actual accounts
- **Secure Operations:** Employs robust security measures to protect sensitive data
- **High Availability:** Designed for reliability and uptime to support business-critical operations
- **Live Data:** Real customer transactions and account balances

### How to Access:
- **Account Setup:** Ensure you have a verified [meCash production account](/account-creation)
- **API Keys:** Obtain [API keys](/authentication) from your meCash Developer dashboard
- **Go-Live:** Only use production after thorough sandbox testing

<Warning>Production transactions involve real money. Test thoroughly in sandbox first!</Warning>

## Switching Between Environments

To switch between environments, simply change the base URL in your API calls:

```bash
# Sandbox
curl -X GET "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/wallets" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_KEY"

# Production  
curl -X GET "https://api.me-cash.com/v1/wallets" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_PRODUCTION_KEY"
```
