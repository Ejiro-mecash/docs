## File Upload

The File Upload API allows you to upload documents such as invoices or receipts that may be required for certain types of payouts or compliance purposes.

### Use Case

When creating a payout, some corridors or transaction types might require supporting documentation (e.g., a business invoice). You can use this endpoint to upload the file first, and then reference the returned `fileId` in your payout request.

### Request Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --location 'https://{{baseURL}}/transaction/v1/file/upload' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
--form 'file=@"/path/to/your/invoice.pdf"'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The endpoint expects a `multipart/form-data` request with the file attached to the `file` field.
</Note>

### Response

A successful upload returns a `fileId` which can be used in subsequent API calls.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "fileId": "1ef54c8c-47b6-4bf0-9c2e-7d410b864fc6"
  }
}
```
