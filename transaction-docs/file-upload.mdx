title: File Upload
---

The File Upload API allows you to upload documents such as invoices or receipts that may be required for certain types of payouts or compliance purposes.

### Use Case

When creating a payout, some corridors or transaction types might require supporting documentation (e.g., a business invoice). You can use this endpoint to upload the invoice first, and then reference the returned `id` as the optional `invoice` field in your payout request.

### Request Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --location 'https://{{baseURL}}/v1/file/invoice' \
--header 'x-api-key: API_KEY_HERE' \
--form 'file=@"/path/to/your/invoice.jpeg"'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The endpoint expects a `multipart/form-data` request with the file attached to the `file` field.
</Note>

### Response

A successful upload returns an `id` which is used as the optional `invoice` field in subsequent payout requests.

```json
{
    "message": "File uploaded successfully",
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "id": "059c23af-eb87-4dc1-8518-8e335c98af30",
        "name": "Bar Deco.jpeg"
    }
}
```
