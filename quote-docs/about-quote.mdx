title: 'How Quotes Works'
---


The **meCash Quote API** returns a guaranteed exchange rate, fee breakdown, and settlement summary before you send money. Presenting this data to your users builds trust and prevents surprises when they confirm a payout.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Every quote response contains a `quoteId`. You must send the same ID when creating a payout so the locked-in rate, fees, and rules are applied.
</Callout>

## Quote lifecycle

When customers request a conversion, your platform should create a quote immediately. The flow below shows how the hand-off between your systems and meCash works.

    participant User as End User
    participant Platform as Your Platform
    participant MeCash as meCash API

    User->>Platform: Request conversion (e.g. NGN → USD)
    activate Platform

    Platform->>MeCash: POST /v1/quote { amount, source, target }
    activate MeCash

    MeCash-->>Platform: quoteId, rate, fees, settlement info
    deactivate MeCash

    Platform-->>User: Display guaranteed amount + charges
    deactivate Platform
```

<Steps>
### User requests a rate
Collect the source amount, currency pair, and payment channel in your UI.
### Platform creates the quote
Send the data to `POST /v1/quote`. meCash evaluates limits, fees, and returns a `quoteId`.
### User confirms
Store the quote and prompt the user to continue to payout before it expires (`expiresInSeconds`).
</Steps>

## What the response contains

- **Totals**: Exchange rate, fee breakdown, and target currency amount.
- **Rules**: Corridor limits and compliance requirements that applied.
- **Expiry**: `expiresInSeconds` tells you how long the quote remains valid.

If the quote expires or fails validation, the payout endpoint returns an error. Refresh the quote and retry the payout with the new `quoteId`.


## Why quotes matter

- **Transparency**: Show the exact amount the recipient will receive before you debit the sender.
- **Compliance**: Respect corridor-specific rules, limits, and required disclosures.
- **User experience**: Prevent failed payouts by validating balances and rates upfront.
