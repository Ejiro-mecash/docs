## How to read these notes

- **Status** clarifies whether the update is fully live or rolling out.
- **Action needed** highlights anything developers must do (schema updates, new scopes, SDK upgrades, etc.).
- **Heads-up** calls out upcoming deprecations so you can plan ahead.

## API Platform

### October 2025 — Platform Release (Status: Live)

- Added new outbound payment routes so you can reach more corridors without custom onboarding—check the API Reference for the latest supported `destinationCountry` values.
- `accountName` is now supported on dynamic virtual account creation, letting you assign customer-friendly names; when omitted, we automatically fall back to your registered business name.

**Action needed:** Pass `accountName` anywhere you need campaign- or store-specific labeling, and refresh your routing matrix to take advantage of the new payout corridors.
