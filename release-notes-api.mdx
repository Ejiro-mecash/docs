## How to read these notes

- **Heads-up** calls out upcoming deprecations so you can plan ahead.

## API Platform

### October 2025 — Platform Release (Status: Live)

- Added new outbound payment routes so you can reach more corridors without custom onboarding—check the API Reference for the latest supported `destinationCountry` values.
- `accountName` is now supported on dynamic virtual account creation, letting you assign customer-friendly names; when omitted, we automatically fall back to your registered business name.

**Action needed:** Pass `accountName` anywhere you need campaign- or store-specific labeling, and refresh your routing matrix to take advantage of the new payout corridors.

### July 12, 2024 — v1.18.0 (Status: Live)

- Added `preferred_settlement_currency` to the Quote API so you can lock settlement currency per request.
- Introduced idempotency keys on `POST /payouts` to prevent accidental duplicate payouts during retries.
- Improved webhook retries with exponential backoff (up to 8 attempts) and clearer `x-mecash-signature` error messaging.

**Action needed:** Update your API client to send the new `Idempotency-Key` header where automated retries exist.

### June 06, 2024 — v1.17.2 (Status: Live)

- Expanded the Transaction API filter set with `status[]=reversed|failed`.
- `/wallets/{id}` now returns a `last_reconciled_at` timestamp for internal audit trails.
- Sandbox now mirrors production rate-limit headers for easier performance testing.

### Coming soon

- Heads-up: Legacy webhook signing secrets (`HMAC-SHA1`) retire on **Aug 30, 2024**. Rotate to the SHA256-based secret under *Developers → Webhooks*.
