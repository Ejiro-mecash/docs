## How to read these notes

- **Status** clarifies whether the update is fully live or rolling out.
- **Action needed** highlights anything developers must do (schema updates, new scopes, SDK upgrades, etc.).
- **Heads-up** calls out upcoming deprecations so you can plan ahead.

## API Platform

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="January 2026 — Version v1.x (Status: Live)">
    **New Features & Enhancements**

    - **Standardized Error Responses**: Unified the structure of error responses across all backend services to provide consistent and predictable feedback for frontend and mobile integrations.
    - **Partner Integration Comms**: Established standardized communication protocols for managing USD virtual account data with Modena.

    **Infrastructure & Performance**

    - **Optimized Account Retrieval**: Updated the virtual account flow to fetch existing account numbers from the database rather than repeatedly calling partner APIs, reducing latency and avoiding downtime.
    - **Deployment Versioning**: Upgraded the infrastructure (Terraform) to ensure services only deploy specific image versions rather than defaulting to "latest," preventing accidental overrides.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="November 2025 — Version v1.x (Status: Live)">
    **New Features**

    - **Crypto On-Ramp Endpoints**: We have exposed new endpoints to support fiat-to-crypto transactions. You can now fetch real-time exchange rates, view fee breakdowns (network vs. transaction fees), and initiate crypto purchases (BTC, ETH, USDT) using NGN.
    - **Credit Transaction Retrieval**: A dedicated endpoint has been added for retrieving and posting credit transactions, ensuring reliable querying for transaction history integrations.
    - **Dynamic Pricing Configuration**: We introduced endpoints to fetch pricing configurations directly from our backend (integrated with Sanity). This allows for dynamic pricing updates without requiring client-side code changes.

    **Improvements**

    - **Payout Validation Enforcement**: To reduce failed transactions, we now enforce mandatory field validation at the API level for **USD**, **EUR**, and **GBP** payout instructions. Incomplete payloads will now return specific validation errors before processing.
    - **Virtual Account Naming**: The `accountName` parameter for Dynamic Virtual Accounts is now optional. If omitted during creation, the system will automatically default to using the registered business name.
    - **Optimized Payout Payloads**: We have removed the need to send redundant `country` and `currency` fields in the Payout API payload, as these are now inherited directly from the associated Quote object.

    **Fixes**

    - **Login Error Messages**: Standardized error responses for failed login attempts. The API now returns a specific "Invalid login credentials" message instead of a generic server error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="October 2025 — Platform Release (Status: Live)">
    - Added new outbound payment routes so you can reach more corridors without custom onboarding—check the API Reference for the latest supported `destinationCountry` values.
    - `accountName` is now supported on dynamic virtual account creation, letting you assign customer-friendly names; when omitted, we automatically fall back to your registered business name.

    **Action needed:** Pass `accountName` anywhere you need campaign- or store-specific labeling, and refresh your routing matrix to take advantage of the new payout corridors.
