## Mobile SDKs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="November 2025 — Mobile Release (v2.5.0) (Status: Live)">
    **New Features**

    - **In-App Document Capture**: You can now take photos of your identity documents (Passport, ID) directly within the app during onboarding, removing the need to upload files from your gallery.
    - **Simplified Onboarding (No BVN)**: To support our international users, the mandatory BVN requirement has been removed from the wallet creation flow. You can now complete sign-up using other valid forms of identification.
    - **Push Notifications (iOS)**: We have enabled push notifications for iOS devices to keep you updated on transaction statuses and account activities.

    **Improvements**

    - **Security Lockout**: Implemented a security feature that automatically locks an account after **3 consecutive failed login attempts** to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Fee Awareness Modal**: When funding your wallet, a new modal will appear explicitly stating the processing fees (e.g., 1% capped at ₦1,500) before you proceed.
    - **Performance Upgrade**: We upgraded the core app engine to **Expo SDK 52**. This improves overall app stability, performance, and ensures full compliance with the latest Google Play Store requirements.

    **Fixes**

    - **OTP Timer**: Fixed a bug where the OTP countdown timer was running faster than real-time.
