- MWK senders retain local payouts as well as a USD off-ramp for cross-border needs.
- RWF senders can route funds to Nigeria, creating a bi-directional corridor with our NGN -> Rwanda route.
- Bank transfers dominate for cross-border activity, while mobile money remains the fastest option for Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Kenya.
