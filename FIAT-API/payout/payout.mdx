# How Payout works in meCash

The **meCash Payout API** allows you to send funds to recipients via multiple payment channels—such as bank transfers, mobile money, etc.

Every payout **must reference a valid `quoteID`**, which ensures the transaction uses current rates, fees, and rules.

This guide walks you through how the Payout API works, including:

- The end-to-end request flow  
- Required parameters  
- Validation process  
- Common best practices

##  Payout Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a typical payout works:

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### **User Generate a Quote**
- Call the Quote API to generate a `quoteID`.
- The quote contains:
  - The exchange rate (if applicable)
  - Transaction fees
  - Rules and expiry time

Quotes ensure that the payout terms (fees, limits, and rates) are noted before execution.

---

### **Call the Payout API**
Once you have a valid `quoteID`, initiate the payout request by providing:

- `quoteID` (from Step 1)  
- Recipient details (e.g. name, bank account )  
- Payment channel (e.g. `bank_transfer`, `mobile_money`)  
- Amount  
---

### **Payout API Response**
After the payout is triggered, you’ll receive a payout response.
You should receive one of the following webhook events after submission:
- `payout.pending`
- `payout.completed`
- `payout.failed`

Refer to the [Webhooks Documentation](/webhook-event#example-payoutcompleted-ngn-to-cny) for event payload examples.
