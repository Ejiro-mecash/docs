title: 'Dynamic Virtual Account'
---

Dynamic accounts are short-lived, one-time-use bank account numbers. They are designed to streamline payments by ensuring the funds received match a specific, expected amount. They automatically expire after a time limit you define.

This is ideal for invoicing, one-time checkouts, or any scenario where you need to tie a payment directly to a specific transaction.

### **Supported Corridors**
meCash Dynamic accounts currently support: 
- **Nigeria (NGN)**
- **Malawi (MKW)**

## How it Works: The Transaction Flow

This diagram shows the complete lifecycle of a dynamic virtual account, from creation to successful payment.

    participant M as Merchant's Server
    participant A as meCash API
    participant C as Customer
    participant B as Bank

    M->>+A: 1. POST /v1/virtual-account/dynamic
    A-->>-M: 2. 200 OK (Account Details, ExpiryTime)
    M->>C: 3. Display Account Number & Amount
    C->>+B: 4. Pays into Dynamic Account
    B->>+A: 5. Bank Notifies meCash of Payment
    A->>M: 6. Webhook: virtualaccount.completed
    M->>C: 7. Confirm Order / Grant Service

    par Account Expiry
        A->>A: Timer: Wait for 'duration'
        alt No Payment Received
            A->>A: Mark Account as EXPIRED
            A->>M: Webhook: virtualaccount.failed (optional)
        end
    end
```

## Common Use Cases

Dynamic accounts are highly effective for managing one-to-one payments.

- **E-commerce Checkouts**: Generate a unique account for every customer's cart. This provides a secure, one-time payment channel and simplifies reconciliation, as each successful payment maps directly to an order.

- **Invoice Payments**: When issuing an invoice to a client, attach a dynamic account for the exact invoice amount. You'll get an instant webhook when it's paid, automating your accounts receivable.

- **Event Ticketing**: Create a unique account for each ticket reservation. The account can expire after 15 minutes, automatically releasing the ticket back into the pool if not paid.

- **Top-ups & Credits**: Assign a dynamic account for a user's wallet top-up request. Once paid, you can be certain the funds are for that specific user and credit their wallet automatically.

## Request examples

### Custom naming behavior

If you provide an `name`, the same string is applied to the newly created dynamic account. When the field is not supplied, we automatically use the workspace’s registered business name.

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
  "currency": "NGN",
  "country": "NG",
  "amount": 150,
  "duration": 30,
  "reference": "TXN_REF_DYNAMIC_12345678",
  "name": "Spar Ikorodu"
}
```
```json Response
{
    "message": "virtual account created successfully",
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "id": "96f466d3-13b0-4b7d-a0ea-bae189b31b15",
        "firstName": "Spar Ikorodu",
        "lastName": "Spar Ikorodu",
        "email": "N/A",
        "reference": "TXN_REF_DYNAMIC_12345678",
        "account": {
            "name": "Spar Ikorodu",

            "sortCode": "090409",
            "number": "999012XXXX"
        },
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "currency": "NGN",
        "country": "NG",
        "isPermanent": false,

        "created": "2025-11-11T09:35:26.863769692Z"
    }
}

```
</CodeGroup>

<Note> When expiry time elapses, `data.status` changes to `INACTIVE` </Note>

## Error responses

| Status | Meaning | Example message | How to fix |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| 400 | Invalid request. | `Invalid request payload` | Confirm `amount`, `duration`, and required fields are present. |
| 401 | Authentication failed. | `Invalid API key` | Verify the `x-api-key` and environment. |
| 409 | Duplicate reference. | `reference already exists` | Reuse the previous response or provide a new reference. |
| 422 | Amount mismatch. | `Amount must be greater than zero` | Provide a positive number. |
| 500 | Server error. | `Server failed to process request.` | Retry later or contact support if persistent. |

## Webhooks

Payments to the dynamic account trigger webhooks:

- `virtualaccount.completed` — deposit succeeded and the wallet was credited.
- `virtualaccount.failed` — payment attempt failed or expired.

Check [`webhooks-event`](/webhooks-event) for payload schemas and signature verification instructions.

## Best practices

- Pass `name` when you need customer-facing labeling (campaigns, store fronts). Skip it to fall back to your registered business name automatically.
- Use a unique `reference` per transaction to keep your ledger idempotent.
- Expire accounts as soon as the invoice is paid by deleting or ignoring them once you receive the webhook.
- Display a countdown timer in your UI using the `expiryTime` so payers know when the account will close.
