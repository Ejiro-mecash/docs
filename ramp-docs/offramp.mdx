The **Offramp** feature allows you to convert your cryptocurrency holdings (such as USDC, ETH, or USDT) into fiat currency (such as NGN, USD, EUR, or GBP) and receive the funds directly in your bank account.

## Overview

Offramp is the process of "exiting" from cryptocurrency back into traditional fiat currency. With meCash Offramp, you can:

- Convert crypto to fiat at competitive exchange rates
- Receive funds via bank transfer or mobile money
- Track conversions in real-time
- Access multiple fiat currency destinations

  Offramp transactions follow the same flow as crypto-to-crypto withdrawals but settle in fiat currency to the recipient's bank account.
