## Gas Fees

Withdrawals require gas fees to be processed on the blockchain. The gas fee is automatically calculated and displayed during the withdrawal process.

| **Fee Level** | **Speed** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Low | Slower | Lower cost, longer confirmation time |
| Medium | Standard | Balanced cost and speed (default) |
| High | Faster | Higher cost, faster confirmation |

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Gas fees are paid in the native token of the network (e.g., ETH for Ethereum). The fee is typically deducted from your transaction summary.
</Callout>

### Valid Address Format

For Ethereum-based networks (ERC20), addresses must:
- Start with `0x`
- Be 42 characters long
- Contain only hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f, A-F)
