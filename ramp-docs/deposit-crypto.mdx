The **Deposit Crypto** feature allows you to fund your meCash cryptocurrency wallet by sending supported assets from any external wallet or exchange to your dedicated meCash wallet address.

## Overview

When you deposit crypto to your meCash wallet, you receive a unique wallet address specific to your account and the selected network. You can send supported assets (like USDC, USDT, or Ether) from any compatible wallet or exchange to this address, and the funds will be credited to your meCash balance once confirmed on the blockchain.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Important**: Only send supported assets to the provided address. Sending unsupported assets or using the wrong network will result in **permanent loss of funds**.

## Before You Deposit

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify the Network">
    Ensure you're sending your asset on the same network displayed in the deposit modal. For example, if the modal shows "Ethereum (ERC20)", send via the Ethereum network.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Double-Check the Address">
    Always verify the wallet address before sending. Copy the address directly from the meCash dashboard rather than typing it manually.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account for Gas Fees">
    When sending from an external wallet, ensure you have enough ETH (or native network token) to cover the gas fees for the transaction.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Minimum Deposit Amount">
    There is no minimum deposit amount, but very small deposits may not be cost-effective due to gas fees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues

    - Transaction is still pending on the blockchain
