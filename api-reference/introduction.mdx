# API Reference

Welcome to the meCash API Reference! This comprehensive guide provides everything you need to integrate with the meCash platform, from authentication to advanced features.

## Getting Started

The meCash API allows you to:
- **Send and receive payments** across multiple currencies and countries
- **Manage virtual accounts** for seamless payment collection
- **Handle cryptocurrency operations** through our RAMP API
- **Track transactions** with real-time status updates
- **Create quotes** for currency conversions

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key.

Your API key can be obtained from your **Dashboard (Sandbox) → Developers → API Keys**. Keep it secure and never expose it in client-side code.
