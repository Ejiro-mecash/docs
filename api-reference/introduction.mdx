Welcome to the meCash API Reference! 
This guide provides everything you need to start integrating with our platform. All API endpoints are available for testing in our Sandbox environment.

---
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to configure your account and make your first API call in minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Whitelist Your IP Address">
    For security, all API requests must come from a whitelisted IP address.

    Navigate to the **Developers → IP Whitelisting** section of your meCash Dashboard to add your server's IP address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Get Your Sandbox API Key">
    You'll need a Sandbox API key to authenticate your requests. 
    
    You can find and copy your key from the **Developers → API Keys** section on your dashboard. Keep this key secure and do not expose it in client-side code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Make Your First Request">
    The easiest way to start is with our interactive playground.

    1.  Navigate to any endpoint in the sidebar (e.g., **Wallets > Get All Wallets**).
    2.  In the "Authentication" section, paste your Sandbox API key.
    3.  Click **Send** to make a live API call to our sandbox.
  </Step>
</Steps>
