Welcome to the meCash API Reference! 

Everything here runs against Sandbox, so line up the essentials below and you can be testing endpoints in minutes.

## Before you start

1. Copy your **Sandbox API key** from **Developers → API Keys** (environment toggle set to Sandbox).
2. Add every server/VPN IP to **Developers → IP Whitelisting → Sandbox**—unlisted IPs return `403`.
3. Use the sandbox base URL `https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com` plus JSON headers (`Content-Type` / `Accept`).

## Getting Started

Use the built-in **Try it** panel to send real Sandbox calls without leaving the docs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick an endpoint">
    Choose an endpoint in the sidebar (e.g., **Wallets → Get All Wallets**) and open the **Try it** drawer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate once">
    Select the **Sandbox** environment, paste your API key under **Authentication**, and Mintlify auto-adds the `Bearer` header for every request.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send & inspect">
    Edit path/query/body fields, click **Send**, then review the live response, headers, and generated cURL snippet you can reuse elsewhere.
  </Step>
</Steps>

> **Heads-up:** `401` means the API key is missing or expired. `403` almost always indicates the calling IP still needs to be whitelisted in Sandbox.
