## 3. Webhook Lifecycle Events

Mobile money collections are asynchronous. You should listen for the following webhook events (detailed in the [Collection Webhook](/webhook/collection-webhook) guide) to track the payment lifecycle:

| Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `collection.initiated` | The collection request has been sent to the provider. |
| `collection.processing` | The customer has been prompted and we are awaiting authorization. |
| `collection.completed` | The payment was successful and funds have been added to your wallet. |
| `collection.failed` | The payment was rejected or timed out. |

<Tip>
Ensure your webhook URL is correctly configured and [verified](/webhook/validate-webhook) to receive these notifications.
