    After the transfer clears, refresh the wallet dashboard. The updated balance appears alongside a credit entry in the transaction log so you can reconcile it with internal records.

      Bank processing times vary by corridor. Local transfers often clear within minutes, while cross-border or high-value payments can take longer. Reach out to support if a deposit hasn’t landed after the expected window.
