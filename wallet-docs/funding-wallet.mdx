### Transfer the funds
Use your banking app or online banking platform to send the desired amount using the provided details. Include any reference code shown in the modal.

### Confirm the deposit
After the bank processes the transfer, refresh the dashboard to see the updated balance. The transaction history lists the credit so you can reconcile it with your records.
