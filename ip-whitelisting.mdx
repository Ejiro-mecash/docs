To use the meCash API, you must first add at least one trusted IP address. Requests coming from non-whitelisted sources are rejected automatically, keeping your integration secure.

## What happens if an IP isn’t whitelisted?

```json "403 Forbidden"
{
  "message": "Forbidden: Your IP address is not whitelisted to access this resource."
}
```

Your API keys remain inactive until a valid IP is on the list, so complete this step before attempting live calls.
