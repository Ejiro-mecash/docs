To use the meCash API services, you must whitelist your IP address. 
This is a mandatory security step.

IP whitelisting ensures that only authorized servers can access your API endpoints. 
Requests from non-whitelisted IPs will be denied.



## ⚠️ Error Response for Non-Whitelisted IPs:

```json "403 Forbidden"
{
  "message": "Forbidden: Your IP address is not whitelisted to access this resource."
}

```
Also, remember that your API keys remain inactive until you've whitelisted at least one IP address.
