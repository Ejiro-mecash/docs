| **Status** | **Message** | **What it means** | **How to fix** |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 400 | `Invalid country or currency ISO code` | The country/currency pair is not supported for virtual accounts. | Send valid ISO codes that match an enabled corridor (e.g., `USD` + `US`). |
| 400 | `Phone number must include valid country code` | `phoneNumber` is missing a proper international prefix. | Format phone numbers with the full country code (for example `+234...`). |
| 400 | `Request JSON malformed or missing required fields` | The payload is missing mandatory keys or is not valid JSON. | Validate that fields such as `currency`, `country`, `reference`, `accountName`, `gender`, `dateOfBirth`, `nationality`, `idType`, `idNumber`, `address`, `city`, `postalCode`, and `company` are present before calling the API. |
| 401 | `API key missing or incorrect` | Authentication header is missing, invalid, or expired. | Ensure the `x-api-key` is included for the correct environment. |
| 409 | `Reference must be unique` | The `reference` has already been used for another request. | Reuse the initial response or send a new, unique reference. |
| 500 | `Service temporarily unavailable` | Temporary backend/database outage prevented the request from succeeding. | Retry with backoff or contact support if it persists. |
