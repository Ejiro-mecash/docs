## Create Virtual Account

The Create Virtual Account API allows you to generate virtual bank accounts for receiving payments. These accounts can be used to collect payments from customers, making it easier to manage incoming funds without sharing your main business account details.

### What are Virtual Accounts?

Virtual accounts are temporary or dedicated bank accounts that are linked to your main meCash account. They provide:

- **Unique Account Numbers**: Each virtual account has its own account number
- **Automatic Reconciliation**: Funds are automatically credited to your main account

- **Enhanced Security**: Keep your main account details private
