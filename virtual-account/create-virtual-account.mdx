<Note>
**The Virtual accounts creation details are also sent via webhook**.
For USD Virtual Accounts, the API response will have a `PROCESSING` status. You must listen for the `virtualaccount.creation.completed` webhook to receive the full account details (Account Number, Bank Name, etc.).
FOR NGN AND MWK Virtual Accounts, the API response and Webhook will have the account creation details.

## Error responses

Use this table as the source of truth for troubleshooting `POST /v1/virtual-account`.

| **Status** | **Message** | **What it means** | **How to fix** |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 400 | `Invalid country or currency ISO code` | The country/currency pair is not supported for virtual accounts. | Send valid ISO codes that match an enabled corridor. |
| 400 | `Phone number must include valid country code` | `phoneNumber` is missing a proper international prefix. | Format phone numbers with the full country code (for example `+234...`). |
| 400 | `Request JSON malformed or missing required fields` | The payload is missing mandatory keys or is not valid JSON. | Validate that fields such as `currency`, `country`, `reference`, and `accountName` are present before calling the API. |
| 400 | `BVN is required` | The Nigerian BVN field is absent when it is mandatory. | Provide the 11-digit `bvn` for NGN accounts. |
| 401 | `API key missing or incorrect` | Authentication header is missing, invalid, or expired. | Ensure the `x-api-key` is included for the correct environment. |
| 409 | `Reference must be unique` | The `reference` has already been used for another request. | Reuse the initial response or send a new, unique reference. |
| 500 | `Service temporarily unavailable` | Temporary backend/database outage prevented the request from succeeding. | Retry with backoff or contact support if it persists. |
