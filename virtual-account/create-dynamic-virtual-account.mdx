| **Status** | **Message** | **What it means** | **How to fix** |
|--------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| 400 | `Invalid Payload` | Required fields are missing or the JSON body fails validation. | Rebuild the payload with the expected schema (`currency`, `country`, `amount`, `duration`, `reference`, etc.). |
| 400 | `Duration must be an integer` | `duration` was provided as a string/float or omitted. | Supply duration as an integer number of minutes (e.g., `30`). |

| 409 | `Reference must be unique` | The `reference` value already exists from an earlier request. | Reuse the first response or generate a new reference. |
| 500 | `Service temporarily unavailable` | Temporary backend outage. | Retry later with exponential backoff; contact support if it persists. |
