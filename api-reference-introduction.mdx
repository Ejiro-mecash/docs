Welcome to the meCash API Reference! 
This guide provides everything you need to start integrating with our platform. All API endpoints are available for testing in our Sandbox environment, so make sure your sandbox workspace is fully configured before firing requests.

## Sandbox prerequisites

Before calling any endpoint, confirm the following items inside the Sandbox environment of your meCash Dashboard:

1. Switch the dashboard environment toggle to **Sandbox** so you can manage sandbox-only resources (API keys, allowlists, webhook secrets).
2. Generate a **Sandbox API key** under **Developers → API Keys** and store it securely—this is the credential you pass via the `Authorization: Bearer <SANDBOX_API_KEY>` header.
3. Add every server, VPN, and CI/CD IP address to **Developers → IP Whitelisting (Sandbox tab)**; requests from non-whitelisted IPs fail immediately.
4. Copy the sandbox base URL `https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com` into your API client and set default headers (`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/json`).
5. (Optional) Create webhook signing secrets, idempotency keys, or environment variables you'll re-use during end-to-end testing.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps—in order—to configure your account and make your first API call in minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Get Your Sandbox API Key">
    You'll need a Sandbox API key to authenticate your requests. 
    
    Go to **Developers → API Keys**, confirm you're viewing Sandbox, and create or copy the key. Keep this credential secret and never expose it in client-side code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Whitelist Your IP Addresses">
    For security, all API requests must come from a whitelisted IP address.

    Navigate to **Developers → IP Whitelisting → Sandbox**, add your outbound server/VPN IPs, and save. Requests from unlisted IPs return `403` errors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Configure Your Environment">
    Set the sandbox base URL `https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com`, add the `Authorization: Bearer <SANDBOX_API_KEY>` header, and send JSON payloads.

    Store these values as environment variables (Postman, cURL, Mintlify explorer, or your backend config) so all future calls use the correct credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Make Your First Request">
    The easiest way to start is with our interactive playground.

    1.  Navigate to any endpoint in the sidebar (e.g., **Wallets > Get All Wallets**).
    2.  In the "Authentication" section, paste your Sandbox API key.
    3.  Click **Send** to make a live API call to our sandbox.
  </Step>
</Steps>
