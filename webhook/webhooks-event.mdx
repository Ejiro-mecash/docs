## Webhooks & Events

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your meCash account.

## Overview

Webhooks are HTTP POST requests sent to your server when specific events occur. They contain event data in JSON format and are sent with a signature for security verification.

## Supported Events

- `transaction.created` - New transaction initiated.
- `transaction.completed` - Transaction successfully completed.
- `transaction.failed` - Transaction failed.
- `payout.created` - New payout initiated.
- `payout.completed` - Payout successfully completed.
- `payout.failed` - Payout failed.
- `quote.created` - New quote generated.
- `quote.expired` - Quote expired.

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Log into your meCash Business dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Developer** â†’ **Webhooks**.
3. Click **Add Webhook Endpoint**.
4. Enter your webhook URL (must be HTTPS).
5. Select the events you want to receive.
6. Save the configuration.

## Webhook Payload Format

```json
{
  "event": "transaction.completed",
  "data": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_123456789",
    "amount": "1000.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z",
  "webhook_id": "webhook_123456789"
}
```

## Security

Each webhook includes a signature in the `X-meCash-Signature` header for verification.

## Best Practices

- Handle duplicate webhooks (check `webhook_id`).
- Respond with HTTP 200 within 10 seconds.
- Always verify webhook signatures.
- Log all webhook events for debugging.
