title: Webhooks

Webhooks are a way for meCash to send your application automatic notifications whenever specific events take place. Instead of your application constantly asking meCash for updates, meCash pushes information to you in real-time.

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant A as meCash System
        participant B as Your Webhook Endpoint
        A->>A: Event occurs (payout, collection, etc.)
        A->>B: Send secure HTTP POST with event payload
        B-->>A: Return 2XX acknowledgment
        B->>B: Validate X-Signature using HMAC-512
        B->>B: Confirm authenticity of the request
    ```
    The process is straightforward:
    1. **An Event Occurs**: Something happens in your account, like a successful payout or a collection.
    2. **meCash Sends a Request**: We send a secure HTTP POST request containing the event details to the webhook URL you've configured.
    3. **You Acknowledge and Verify**: Your server acknowledges receipt by returning a `2XX` status code and then validates the request's signature to confirm it's genuinely from meCash.

  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Webhook Security">
    <Callout type="info" emoji="🛡️">
      All meCash webhook events are signed using an `HMAC-512` signature in the `X-Signature` header. The signature is computed from the raw request body using your webhook secret key (found in **Developers → Webhooks** in your dashboard). Always verify this signature before processing the event to ensure authenticity and prevent replay attacks.
    </Callout>
    - Reject requests with missing or invalid signatures.
    - Log every webhook delivery for auditability.
    - Retry failed processing gracefully and return `2XX` only after you persist the event.
