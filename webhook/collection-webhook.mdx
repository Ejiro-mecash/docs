# Webhook Event : Collection Lifecycle

This event notifies you about the status of a collection (funding) transaction. Collections follow a lifecycle with different states: `collection.initiated`, `collection.processing`, `collection.completed`, and `collection.failed`.

- **Initiated**: The request has been successfully sent to the provider.
- **Processing**: The customer has been notified and we are awaiting authorization.
- **Completed**: The funds have been successfully collected and added to the wallet.
- **Failed**: The collection could not be completed.
