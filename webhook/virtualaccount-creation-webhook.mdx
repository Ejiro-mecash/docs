title: Virtual Account Creation Webhook Event
description: Reference for the `virtualaccount.creation.completed` webhook event, triggered when a virtual account has been successfully created and account details are ready.
---

This webhook is sent when a virtual account has been successfully created. For asynchronous corridors like **USD**, this webhook is the primary way to receive the permanent account number and SWIFT/routing details. For other corridors like **NGN** or **MWK**, this webhook is sent in addition to the API response.
