title: Validating Webhook Signatures
description: How to securely validate incoming webhook events from meCash using HMAC-512 signatures.
---

To ensure your application processes only legitimate requests from **meCash**, every webhook event is signed with a unique signature.  
Verifying this signature is a **critical security measure** to protect your endpoint from malicious or accidental requests.

---

## Step-by-Step Verification Guide

<Info> You can find your **secret key** for each webhook endpoint in the **Developers ‚Üí Webhooks** section of your meCash dashboard.</Info>

### Step 1: Extract the Signature  
Get the value of the `X-Signature` header from the incoming request.  

<Tip>**Note:** HTTP headers are case-insensitive, so `x-signature` and `X-Signature` are treated the same.</Tip>

---

### Step 2: Prepare the Payload for Hashing  
You must use the **raw, unmodified JSON body** of the request.  
Do **not** parse and re-stringify the JSON ‚Äî changes in whitespace or key order will alter the computed hash and cause verification to fail.

---

### Step 3: Compute Your Expected Signature  
Calculate an **HMAC-512** hash of the raw request body (from Step 2) using your endpoint's secret key.

---

### Step 4: Compare the Signatures  
Compare the signature you computed with the one from the `X-Signature` header.  
If they match, the request is valid.

<Warning> **Security Best Practice:** Use a timing-attack-safe comparison method instead of `==` or `===`.  
This prevents attackers from guessing valid signatures by measuring response times.</Warning>

<Warning> **üõ°Ô∏è Replay Attack Prevention:** If your webhook request includes a timestamp (in headers or payload), validate that it‚Äôs within a short window (e.g., 5 minutes).  
  Reject older requests to prevent replayed webhooks from being processed. </Warning>
