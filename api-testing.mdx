## Basic Authentication Test

Test your API key authentication with the sandbox environment:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/wallets" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Wallets retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "wallets": []
  }
}
```

## Testing Common Endpoints

### 1. Get All Wallets

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/wallets" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY"
```

### 2. Create a Quote

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/quotes" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_currency": "USD",
    "to_currency": "EUR",
    "amount": "1000.00"
  }'
```

### 3. Create a Payout

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v2/payouts" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "100.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "recipient_name": "John Doe",
    "recipient_email": "john@example.com",
    "bank_code": "US001",
    "account_number": "1234567890"
  }'
```

## Simulating Payout States

In the sandbox environment, you can simulate different payout outcomes to test your webhook handling. This is particularly useful for testing error scenarios and ensuring your integration handles failed payouts correctly.

### Simulating a Failed Payout

To simulate a payout failure and trigger the `payout.failed` webhook, simply include **"failed"** as the `remark` field in your payout request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v2/payouts" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "100.00",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "recipient_name": "John Doe",
    "bank_code": "058",
    "account_number": "1234567890",
    "remark": "fail"
  }'
```

<Info>
When you include `"remark": "fail"` in your payout request, the system will process the payout as a failure and send a `payout.failed` webhook to your configured webhook URL. This allows you to test your failure handling logic without real transactions.
</Info>

### Expected Webhook Response

After submitting a payout with `"remark": "fail"`, you will receive a `payout.failed` webhook event:

```json
{
  "event": "payout.failed",
  "data": {
    "id": "8b99b9d8-998a-48db-9102-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "referenceNumber": "RRT6CBX1NMGUJ",
    "type": "SEND",
    "state": "FAILED",
    "quote": {
      "id": "68d2bae4-7365-42fc-bbc2-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "source": { "currency": "NGN", "amount": 100 },
      "target": { "currency": "NGN", "amount": 100 },
      "rate": 1,
      "fee": { "amount": 5 },
      "summary": { "total": 105 }
    },
    "recipient": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "account": { "sortCode": "058", "accountNumber": "1234567890" },
      "currency": "NGN",
      "country": "NG",
      "stored": false
    },
    "created": "2025-03-13T15:28:37.258Z",
    "processed": "2025-03-13T15:28:37.258Z"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
Use this feature alongside [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to inspect and debug your webhook payloads in real-time.

## Postman Collection

Import this collection into Postman for easy testing:

```json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "meCash API",
    "description": "meCash API testing collection"
  },
  "variable": [
    {
      "key": "base_url",
      "value": "https://api.me-cash.com"
    },
    {
      "key": "api_key",
      "value": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  ],
  "request": [
    {
      "name": "Get Wallets",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "header": [
          {
            "key": "x-api-key",
            "value": "{{api_key}}"
          }
        ],
        "url": {
          "raw": "{{base_url}}/v1/wallets"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Testing

Test error scenarios to ensure proper handling:

### Invalid API Key
```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/wallets" \
  -H "x-api-key: INVALID_KEY"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "errorCode": "INVALID_API_KEY",
  "message": "The provided API key is invalid"
}
```

### Missing Required Fields
```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/quotes" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_currency": "USD"
  }'
```

## Rate Limit Testing

Test rate limits by making multiple rapid requests:

```bash
for i in {1..15}; do
  curl -X GET "https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com/v1/wallets" \
    -H "x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY" &
done
wait
```

## Webhook Testing

Test webhook endpoints using tools like webhook.site:

1. Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
2. Copy the provided URL
3. Add it to your meCash webhook configuration
4. Trigger events to see webhook payloads

## Environment Variables

Set up environment variables for testing:

```bash
export MECASH_SANDBOX_API_KEY="your_sandbox_api_key_here"
export MECASH_SANDBOX_URL="https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com"

```

Then use in your requests:
```bash
# Sandbox testing
curl -X GET "$MECASH_SANDBOX_URL/v1/wallets" \
  -H "x-api-key: $MECASH_SANDBOX_API_KEY"

```
