## Production Environment

The production environment is where your live transactions are processed. This guide covers everything you need to know about using meCash API in production.

## Production Base URL

```
https://api.me-cash.com
```

## Getting Production Access

### Prerequisites

Before accessing the production environment, ensure you have:

1. **Completed KYB Verification**: Your business must be fully verified
2. **Sandbox Testing**: Thoroughly tested your integration in sandbox
3. **Production API Keys**: Generated production API keys from your dashboard

### Requesting Production Access

1. **Complete KYB Verification**
   - Ensure all business documents are approved
   - Verify your business contact information
   - Complete any additional verification steps

2. **Submit Production Access Request**
   - Contact support at [support@me-cash.com](mailto:support@me-cash.com)
   - Include your business details and use case
   - Provide sandbox testing evidence

3. **Wait for Approval**
   - Production access is reviewed manually
   - Approval typically takes 2-5 business days
   - You'll receive email notification when approved

## Production API Keys

### Generating Production Keys

1. Log into your meCash Business dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developer** → **API Keys**
3. Switch to **Production** environment
4. Click **Create Production Key**
5. Securely store your production API key

<Warning>
Production API keys process real money transactions. Keep them secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

### Key Differences from Sandbox

| Feature | Sandbox | Production |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Base URL** | `https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com` | `https://api.me-cash.com` |
| **Transactions** | Simulated | Real money |
| **Rate Limits** | Standard | Higher limits available |
| **Support** | Community | Priority support |
| **Monitoring** | Basic | Advanced monitoring |

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Store keys in environment variables
const API_KEY = process.env.MECASH_API_KEY;

// ❌ Bad: Never hardcode keys
const API_KEY = "live_sk_1234567890abcdef";
```

### IP Whitelisting

Production environments require stricter IP whitelisting:

1. **Static IPs Only**: Use static IP addresses for your servers
2. **Multiple IPs**: Whitelist all server IPs that will make API calls
3. **Regular Updates**: Update whitelist when server IPs change

### HTTPS Requirements

All production API calls must use HTTPS:

```bash
# ✅ Correct production endpoint
curl -X POST https://api.me-cash.com/v2/payout

# ❌ Never use HTTP in production
curl -X POST http://api.me-cash.com/v2/payout
```

## Rate Limits

### Production Rate Limits

| Limit Type | Standard | Enhanced |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Requests per minute** | 100 | 1,000 |
| **Requests per hour** | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| **Requests per day** | 10,000 | 100,000 |

### Requesting Higher Limits

Contact support to request higher rate limits:

```json
{
  "business_name": "Your Business Name",
  "expected_volume": "transactions per day",
  "use_case": "Brief description of your use case",
  "current_limits": "current rate limits you're hitting"
}
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Production Monitoring

Production accounts include enhanced monitoring:

1. **Real-time Metrics**: Track API performance and errors
2. **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor payout success rates
3. **Alert System**: Get notified of issues immediately

### Setting Up Alerts

1. **Dashboard Alerts**: Configure alerts in your dashboard
2. **Email Notifications**: Set up email alerts for critical events
3. **Webhook Monitoring**: Monitor webhook delivery status

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **API Response Times**: Should be under 2 seconds
- **Error Rates**: Should be under 1%
- **Transaction Success Rates**: Should be over 95%
- **Webhook Delivery**: Should be 100% successful

## Testing in Production

### Gradual Rollout

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small transaction amounts
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for any issues or errors
3. **Scale Gradually**: Increase volume as confidence grows

### Testing Strategies

```javascript
// Example: Gradual rollout implementation
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const maxTestAmount = isProduction ? 100 : 10000; // Lower limits in production

if (amount > maxTestAmount) {
  throw new Error('Amount exceeds production testing limits');
}
```

## Compliance & Regulations

### Regulatory Requirements

Production usage must comply with:

1. **AML/KYC**: Anti-money laundering and know your customer
2. **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry data security standards
3. **GDPR**: General data protection regulation (if applicable)
4. **Local Regulations**: Country-specific financial regulations

### Documentation Requirements

Maintain documentation for:

1. **Transaction Records**: Keep detailed transaction logs
2. **Audit Trails**: Maintain audit trails for compliance
3. **User Verification**: Document user verification processes

## Support & Escalation

### Production Support

Production accounts receive priority support:

- **Response Time**: 2-4 hours for critical issues
- **Availability**: 24/7 for production issues
- **Escalation**: Direct escalation to engineering team

### Emergency Contacts

For production emergencies:

- **Email**: [support@me-cash.com](mailto:support@me-cash.com)
- **Subject**: "PRODUCTION EMERGENCY - [Brief Description]"
- **Phone**: Available for enterprise customers

## Migration from Sandbox

### Migration Checklist

- [ ] Complete KYB verification
- [ ] Test all API endpoints in sandbox
- [ ] Generate production API keys
- [ ] Update application configuration
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoints
- [ ] Conduct small-scale testing
- [ ] Monitor initial transactions
- [ ] Scale up gradually

### Configuration Updates

```javascript
// Update your configuration
const config = {
  baseURL: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? 'https://api.me-cash.com' 
    : 'https://sandboxapi.me-cash.com',
  apiKey: process.env.MECASH_API_KEY,
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds for production
  retries: 3 // Retry failed requests
};
```

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables
2. **Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys regularly
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to production credentials
4. **Audit Logs**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs

### Performance

1. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for better performance
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
3. **Async Processing**: Use async processing for better throughput
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor performance metrics continuously

### Reliability

1. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for retries
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers for fault tolerance
4. **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **401 Unauthorized** | Invalid API key | Verify API key format and validity |
| **403 Forbidden** | IP not whitelisted | Add server IP to whitelist |
| **429 Rate Limited** | Too many requests | Implement rate limiting |
| **500 Server Error** | Internal server error | Retry with exponential backoff |

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation**: Review API documentation
2. **Contact Support**: Email support with detailed error information
3. **Community**: Ask questions in Discord community
4. **Status Page**: Check [status.me-cash.com](https://status.me-cash.com) for outages
